iv) None

v) Run the game in 1920x1080 resolution for best results.

First, you will be presented with a main menu. This adds to the polish of our game, as it presents the user with a navigable menu of options that help bring the game together as a whole. You can opt to choose to see the credits, exit the game, view the story, or play the game.

Choose to play the game. When you enter the game, first notice that the game is 3D (which satisfies the 3D game requirement). Next, move around with the character using WASD and the mouse or a game controller. As you can see, the animations are smooth and do not clip. Also, you can hit the spacebar and the player will jump. Move the mouse around to control the direction of the camera. As you may notice, the controls are intuitive and the camera movement is smooth as well. Now, go grab the blue item in front of you. This is an interactive item that you need the collect in the environment. After you pick up the item, you will see a label pop up on the screen indicating how many pieces you have left to collect. This serves to guide the user as to where he/she is at in the progression of the game.

Next turn to the left and you will see a table. Right click on this table to pick it up and then click again to throw it and clear the way. You can pick up certain objects and use them to your advantage. Now, use the E key to shift between this world and the real world (which is much brighter and helpful). Here you have a much better vision as to what is around you and it will help you gauge where you are in the world. Along with this, you may find objects here that you can pick up and bring with you to Hellworld. Lastly, as you enter the real world, you will notice that the building you are in in the real world not have a table and has an opening instead. Use the Shift key to sprint to the outside area and soon, when you are transported back to Hellworld, you will have gotten outside of the structure you were in. This is because the real world and Hellworld differ slightly, so some things might be in the real world that are not in Hellworld. This requires the user to think and utilize the real world when he/she runs into challenges, which adds to the "fun" of the game.

As you sprint, you will notice that both the sprint and world shift do not last forever and must be recharged to use again. This adds to the difficulty of the game. As you move around in the environment, you will notice that it is immersive and contains objects tailored to cater to the experience. You can explore many of the buildings and interact with various objects. Soon, you will start to hear a heart beating sound. This is the monster approaching on you. As the monster gets closer, the heartbeat grows louder and louder. Then, suddenly, the audio cuts off altogether, which we added to make the chase more suspenseful. Now, when the monster gets very close and becomes in sight of the camera, a jump scare sound is played to scare the user. Our goal with the enemy was to make it suspenseful and keep the user on the edge of their seat. As for the AI, the monster has waypoints and navigates around them. When the user comes in proximity, then he/she will be chased by the monster. We have also implemented a teleportation feature with the AI which makes the monster teleport to a random spot near the player if the player gets too far away from the monster. This ensures that the user is often engaged with the AI.

Lastly, you will notice a multitude of things such as sound effects, silence, lighting, and objects, that are used to make the game a more immersive and polished experience as a whole.
